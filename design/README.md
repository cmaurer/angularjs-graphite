### Graphite
[Graphite](https://github.com/graphite-project) is a highly scalable real-time graphing system, that is used by many IT Organizations to collect and graph metrics.

[Angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) is a web application framework that eases development of advanced web applications.

Combining real-time metric with an advanced web application framework enables the development of advanced dashboards, alerting, and analytic tools.

This project's main purpose is to ease the integration between Graphite and Angular.js.
